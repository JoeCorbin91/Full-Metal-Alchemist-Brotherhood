        <p>West City is a city in the western region of Amestris and serves as the military command headquarters for the area. Though little is known about West City and the area under its jurisdiction (as it is the only region of the country not directly visited by the Elric brothers) what is known is that - in the manga - West HQ's forces are frequently in direct conflict with the neighboring country of Creta over the location of the national border. Western military forces are also said to have an impressive number of troops, all adept in guerrilla warfare.

            Chapter 52, when Colonel Mustang's group is forcibly disbanded by the Führer, 2nd Lieutenant Heymans Breda is reassigned to West City's HQ, where he discovers that reckless military strategies have led to a massive death toll in the current border war in the town of Pendleton.
           
            The Western Military seems to have a strong affiliation with Central City's forces, as West HQ is the only region to send military aid to Central during Roy's coup d'état in Chapter 89.</p>

                    <h3>Creta</h3>
                    <p>
                        is a country in the world of Fullmetal Alchemist, located west of the main country of the series, Amestris.

                        At the end of the manga and 2009 anime, Edward Elric ventures to Creta and the nations to the west in order to learn and exchange information about alchemy. In the movie Sacred Star of Milos, the Elric Brothers visit an Amestrian occupied city in Creta's territory called Table City.</li>
                        Creta is a Federal-State composed of several nations reunited under a Union. The Central Government has kept a close watch on the States' affairs, allowing a level of autonomy to each local leaders and keeping them as representatives of the former tribes in the Central Government. This decentralization of power has been a trademark of Creta and has brought many conflicts and problems over the years.
                
                        The tribes that compose Creta are culturally diverse and are known to be extremely unfriendly to each other. This animosity has made the Central Government create borders controlled by the Central Government between the tribe's territories in order to keep physical and influential space between the local governments, acting as a shield to avoid civil conflicts. Those conflicts, however, still exist, keeping the Central Government in permanent alert.</li>
                
                        Creta was founded around the year 900, when the leader of the most influent tribe in the region, called Cretua, decided to unify all neighbor tribes under one government. He implemented a hereditary dynasty of his family, which, eventually, fortified and consolidated the union of those tribes.</li>
                         
                        Creta continually engages Amestris in border disputes, and a great deal of blood has been shed by both sides in their long history as military enemies. In the past, Amestris and Creta fought over the region of Table City, causing great suffering to the native people of that region who were used as cannon fodder by the Cretans and are abused by the Amestrians. At present, the Amestrian city of Pendleton is the center of the latest border war, in which military negligence has caused massive casualties.  This is the region where Lt Breda is sent after Fuhrer Bradley reveals his true history as a Homunculus to Colonel Mustang.</li>

                    <h3>Pendleton</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pendleton is a town on the western border of Amestris and the center of the ongoing border wars between Amestris and the western nation of Creta. As a part of the Nationwide Transmutation Circle, the current struggle in Pendleton has become a scene of massive casualties brought on by apparent instances of military negligence, a point that 2nd Lt. Heymans Breda, who has been stationed nearby, does not neglect to notice and report.

                    <h3>Riviere</h3>
                    <p>
                        Riviere was a small country (or perhaps a city-state) which, over three hundred years prior to the start of the series in July 1558, was attacked by the earliest settlers of the country that would come to be known as Amestris without a declaration of war. The conquest of Riviere would serve as the first major point in Amestrian history as well as the first act of aggression in their long, militant legacy. Now, Riviere is a city in the northwest region of Amestris, still stained with the crest of blood carved into it so many centuries ago. As such, it is a point in the Nationwide Transmutation Circle being constructed by the Homunculi. When 2nd Lt. Vato Falman goes over a list of places of military action, Riviere - the first - stands out in particular as it serves as the first clue to the fact that the nation of Amestris was created from nothing in order to forge the Transmutation Circle.

                    <h3>Tablecity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Table City is a town on the Western border of Amestris within Creta. Due to its proximity to hostile foreign country, security in Table City offers zero tolerance to travelers arriving without official papers. Table City is not mentioned in the manga or either anime series and only appears in Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos.
On a map shown to Ed and Al, Table City appears to be a small section positioned on top of a plateau amid and above several deep gorges that surround it.  In fact, these gorges have been dug out during the Cretan annexation, when the Cretan authorities were searching for the Sanguine Stars they believed to be hidden in and around Table City.  Because of these gorges, Table City can only be reached by either the train lines into it or by a series of secret passageways that most of the inhabitants do not know exist.

Before the train they are on comes within a close distance of the city, armed Amestrian soldiers clamber through the cars demanding to see travel permits and visas from everyone on the train.  When an apparently elderly couple declare that they are visiting to see a newly born grandchild, to Ed and Al's horror a soldier attacks the man, who then reveals that he is a terrorist.  Even though Ed attempted to stop the terrorists from escaping, the soldier then turns on Ed, demanding his papers, only to flinch when Ed shows his silver pocket watch.

For three hundred years, the land now known as Table City was called the Hill of Milos and was inhabited by the Milosians, who believed it was their holy land. However, the land was forcefully annexed by Creta and then by Amestris after a bloody struggle.  The Milosians actually helped Amestris to oust Creta, believing that Amestris would then allow them to resume control of their homeland.  In fact, those who pretended to want to help the Milosians had also heard the legends concerning the Sanguine Star, and may have also wished to secure it.

Major Peter Soyuz is the Amestrian official in charge of Table City, in a similar manner to how Yoki once ruled Youswell for his personal gain.  After Ed and Al locate one of the underground chambers in the hidden underground city, Soyuz reveals that he had hoped that the Elric Brothers would uncover the secrets behind the Sanguine Star so that he could sell it to the highest bidder.

In fact, Table City had been built to design, in order to create a three-dimensional Transmutation Circle that would, under the right circumstances, create a Sanguine Star.  After the events of Sacred Star of Milos, the Milosians regain control of the city and rename it Milos.  Although Colonel Mustang explains that Amestris will attempt to retake the area, both Ed and Al believe that the Milosians will retain their newly won freedom.
