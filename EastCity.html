        <p> East Area is the most diverse region of Amestris as it shelters the nation Ishval. They are culturally very different from the rest of Amestris and there was a huge civil war there as they denounce the use of alchemy, a popular practice in Amestris.</p>
        <p>Their population comprises of “Middle Easterns” or the Ishvalan and Nordic, which have blonde hair and blue eyes (European almost).</p>
        <p>The region is mostly desert.</p>

                    <p>
                        Once believed to be its own nation, Ishval was absorbed by Amestris due to its expansionist values. However, the differing cultures and values created conflict and resulted in the Ishvalan Civil War. 
                    </p>
                    <p>As it is right next to the Great Desert and resides in Amestris’ relatively barren frontier, Ishval is known to be really nothing more than rocks and sand. Its harsh land has no significant natural resources and it is hard to farm on, so it is thought that these aspects helped to nurture a very hostile society. However, it is also thought that they used to be inhabitants of land much more expansive than Ishval, and that the bloodshed created from trying to herd them in like cattle and gain control over them was what actually created their hostility. </p>
                    <p>Amestris may be put to blame, but the larger reason is due to the Central Command and Homunculi who wanted to create a huge transmutation circle in order to create the Philosopher’s stone. </p>
                    <p>By the end of the storyline of Fullmetal Alchemist, Ishval is reinstated as a Holy Land and Amestris helps them to rebuild. This is only after the extermination of the Homunculi and the corrupted Central Command. </p>

                    <h3>East City</h3>
                    <p>
                        East City is the capital of the East Area and also serves as its military command base. This is the city in which Roy Mustang and his subordinates are stationed, as well as where Edward Elric has to make his official reports. 
                    </p>
                    <p>East City isn’t considered much to the rest of Amestris, but it is actually the strongest offensive force being that it is so close to Ishval (a state in unrest full of dangerous people). East City is also home to a lot of veteran military members, again seeing how close it is to Ishval. And like the Northern Brigg’s soldiers, the soldiers in East City hold Lieutenant General Grumman in high regards and even go so far as to disobey Central Command and King Bradley. </p>
