        <h2>Fort Briggs</h2>
        <p>
            Fort Briggs is located in the Briggs mountains, which is cold and snowy all year round. Briggs is the border to the enemy nation of Drachma. Fort Briggs and Drachma had a shaky peace treaty that resulted a time of peace and walking on eggshells. Finally, with Homunculus help, Drachma is provoked to attack Fort Briggs. Fort Briggs stands against the attack and is victorious.
